# nnvisualized
**nnvisualized** allows you to play around with a neural network in realtime and explore how it works directly in the browser.

You can
- edit the network's shape
- try out different activation functions
- experiment with different learning rates
- enter your own training data (or use randomized values)
- switch between different inputs to see how each affects the network's output
